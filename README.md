BRIEF DESCRIPTION-

The purpose of the case study is to classify a given silhouette as one of three different types of
vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from
one of many different angles.
Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double-decker bus, Chevrolet
van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was
chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily
distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.
